## Games Engine 1
## Assignment 2019-2020
Music Visualizer in Unity 3D based
***
### Assignment Description
The aim of the games engine 1 assignment is to create a procedural generation system in unity.

Upon exploring the variety of procedural generation, I decided to make a audio visualization through unity. Choosing the right music piece for the project. Every time I choose a music piece I felt the need to base the pattern on the song is. I picked up a rubik's cube and started solving it, then I know that the song playing at the time is the right music piece and so is the cube perfect for my Games Engine 1 assignment.

### What I did
My Games Engine 1 assignment consists of mostly cubes throughout the course of the music piece. Expanding resizing and randomly changing the colours to the beat of the music.

##### Fast Fourier Transform
Using Fast Fourier Transform(FFT), I extracted audio frequencies samples into and used them to distinguish if the tune is high or low. Once the tunes are identified then they are assigned to a cube then placed on to the scene that would suit and express the note better. I wanted to express the beat of the song through the bursting effect of the cubes expanding and having different colour every time the cubes expand.

##### Phyllotaxis
Using phyllotaxis algorithm mostly in the background to generate cubes that resizes with the beat, felt like stargazing in a quiet night and having music as your only company.

What Phyllotaxis is, it is an arrangement of leaves on a plant stem. the 137.5 degree is a special degree upon implementing the phyllotaxis algorithm, as it creates a perfectly symmetrical position to spawn the cubes and make them look that they're always a lined. http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop-ch4.pdf

##### Music piece
Music used in the Assignment. In the face of evil by Magic sword was the song in the movie Thor Ragnarok.

##### What I am most proud of about the assignment
I am proud of the assignment as a whole. using random coloured cubes in the phyllotaxis formation also surprised me as the note faded out, it felt like focusing on a distant star at night.

> I love listening to music so I am looking forward in creating a music visualizer that will definitely express the emotions visually from the music and display them elegantly.
